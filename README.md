This is a work I did with my classmate Kaiyue Zhang. The whole interface is designed by myself using EGE.

You may see the requirement of the project in 'requirements.md', codes are in 'project_code.cpp'. Further explanations can be found in 'report.pdf', for the translated edition, go for 'report_translated.md'!
