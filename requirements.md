Objective: Try not to capture the opponent's pieces (by surrounding them), and instead, aim to have your own pieces captured (surrounded) by the opponent as much as possible.

What is "Liberty": To understand "capturing," one must first understand "liberty." A stone on the board has "liberties," which are the empty points directly adjacent to it in a straight line. If there are stones of the same color adjacent to it, they form an inseparable group, and their liberties are counted collectively.

What is "Capturing": When a stone has no liberties left, it must be removed from the board. If a stone has opponent's stones directly adjacent to it, those liberties are no longer available. If all its liberties are occupied by the opponent, the stone is in a state of no liberties. A stone in such a state cannot remain on the board and must be removed, which is called "capturing." The action of removing a stone with no liberties from the board is known as "capturing a stone."

Board Specifications: As shown in the diagram, the NoGo board size is 9×9. Note that 9×9 refers to the number of grid points, not the number of squares, as stones are placed on the grid points.
